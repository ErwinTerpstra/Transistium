### About the project

The simplicity of the atomic components underlying digital computers has always fascinated me. Logic gates by themselves are extremely simple, but by combining thousands of others they can do the most complex things.

Series like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU">Ben Eater's breadboard computer</a> and <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">Nand2Tetris</a> inspired me to do some hands-on tinkering.

### Simulation

I don't have the patience to do the expansive breadbording necessary for this, a simulation is more in my alley. There's of course dozens of options available to use, but that's not nearly as fun as building your own.

One of the cool things about the simulation is that even though all the components are constructed hierarchical, the simulation just works with a flat list of transistors and signals. This makes the simulation remarkably simple and pretty fast.
